The second exam of the winter session will be at Aula 3 De Lollis (Via Tiburtina 205 entrance) at 15.00. The exam lasts 2 hours.
As a substitution for Google Classroom, results will be published in this page.

You can find the exam schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRNStERU3HHasfA0g2U_GG-lbwWho9fZ6r-iN08FGbJZtqUmEdvBPL7nv7P-YiKMimmVLLcAwyoMkYh/pubhtml?gid=1867867947&single=true)

The project, whose text can also be found here [here](https://danielefriolo.github.io/files/project.pdf), can be submitted either with Google Classroom (if you are logged) or with my e-mail friolo (dot) di (et) uniroma1 (dot) it.
