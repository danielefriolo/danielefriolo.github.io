Recently, there has been great interest towards constructing efficient zero-knowledge proofs for prac-
tical languages. In this work, we focus on proofs for threshold relations, in which the prover is required
to prove knowledge of witnesses for k out of l statements.
The main contribution of our work is an efficient and modular transformation that starting from a
large class of Σ-protocols and a corresponding threshold relation R_k,l provides an efficient Σ-protocol
for Rk,` with improved communication complexity w.r.t. prior results. Moreover, our transformation
preserves statistical/perfect honest-verifier zero knowledge.
